# Rainfall Prediction Dashboard

This project was developed as part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**. Our team focused on **predicting rainfall in a specific region** using machine learning models and visualizing the results through an interactive dashboard.

## Description
The goal of this project was to leverage data science techniques to **forecast rainfall patterns** and provide a **visual representation of predictions** for better understanding and decision-making. We trained models using historical weather data and designed an interactive dashboard to communicate insights effectively.

## Tools Used
- **Orange** – for data preprocessing, visualization, and training machine learning models
- **Power BI** – for building interactive dashboards to display predictions
- **Excel**
- **Data Sources** – public rainfall datasets (mention exact source if used)

## What I Did
- Built **machine learning models** in Orange to predict rainfall
  
## Outcome
- Successfully created a **predictive model for regional rainfall**
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** to display predictions and trends visually
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining **machine learning with data visualization**
- Project can be extended for **real-time forecasting and more regions**
